Example
-------
```csharp
[TestMethod]
public void CommonAssertionsIOSControls()
{
    var button = App.ElementCreateService.CreateByName<Button>("ComputeSumButton");

    button.Click();

    button.EnsureIsNotDisabled();

    var answerLabel = App.ElementCreateService.CreateByValueContaining<Label>("Label");

    answerLabel.EnsureIsVisible();

    var password = App.ElementCreateService.CreateById<Password>("IntegerB");

    password.SetPassword("9");

    var textField = App.ElementCreateService.CreateById<TextField>("IntegerA");

    textField.SetText("1");

    textField.EnsureTextIs("1");
}
```

Explanations
------------
There cases when you need to show your colleagues or managers what tests do you have. Sometimes you may have manual test cases, but their maintenance and up-to-date state are questionable. Also, many times you need additional work to associate the tests with the test cases. Some frameworks give you a way to write human readable tests through the Gherkin language. The main idea is non-technical people to write these tests. However, we believe this approach is doomed. Or it is doable only for simple tests. This is why in BELLATRIX we built a feature that generates the test cases after the tests execution. After each action or assertion, a new entry is logged.

After the test is executed the following log is created:

```
Start Test
Start Test
Class = BDDLoggingTests Name = CommonAssertionsIOSControls
Ensure control(Name = ComputeSumButton) is NOT disabled
Ensure control(Value containing Label) is visible
Set password '9' in control(Id = IntegerB)
Set text '1' in control(Id = IntegerA)
Ensure control(Id = IntegerA) text is '1'
```

Configuration
-------------
```json
"logging": {
    "isEnabled": "true",
    "isConsoleLoggingEnabled": "true",
    "isDebugLoggingEnabled": "true",
    "isEventLoggingEnabled": "false",
    "isFileLoggingEnabled": "true",
    "outputTemplate":  "{Message:lj}{NewLine}",
}
```
In the **testFrameworkSettings.json** file find a section called logging, responsible for controlling the BDD logs generation. You can disable the logs entirely. There are different places where the logs are populated. By default, you can see the logs in the output window of each test. Also, a file called logs.txt is generated in the folder with the DLLs of your tests. If you execute your tests in CI with some CLI test runner the logs are printed there as well. **outputTemplate** - controls how the message is formatted. You can add additional info such as timestamp and much more.
