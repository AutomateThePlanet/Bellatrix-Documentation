Cross-platform screenshot and video recording on test failure. Extend the framework to fit your needs. Test responsive layouts and much more.

### Additional Create Methods ###
BELLATRIX extends the vanilla WebDriver selectors and give you additional methods. [**Learn more**](/locate-elements.md).

### Screenshots on Fail ###
Checks after each test, its result, if failed, makes the screenshots. [**Learn more**](/troubleshooting-screenshots-on-fail.md).

### Video recording on Fail ###
Checks after each test, its result, depending on the specified video saves the video. [**Learn more**](/troubleshooting-video-recording.md).

### Common Controls ###
18+ desktop controls. All of them implement Proxy design pattern which means that they are not located immediately when they are created. Another benefit is that each of them includes only the actions that you should be able to do with the specific control and nothing more.[**Learn more**](/common-controls.md).
