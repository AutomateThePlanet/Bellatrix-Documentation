Overview
--------
Every few months, we release new versions of our BELLATRIX libraries and tooling. With every major release, we bring many bug fixes, enhancements, and new features. Here you will find detailed steps how you can keep your BELLATRIX projects up to date.

Simple Update Steps
------------------
Download the new version of BELLATRIX as a zip file or clone the repository.

Using New Features
--------------------------
Some features require specific settings to be present in the **testFrameworkSettings.json** file. Read the documentation about the feature you want to start to use. Add the necessary configuration to your settings files.

In case you need additional help, you can use our Standard Support, Professional Services add-ons. Otherwise, you can open a new issue/question in our GitHub repository.
