How to Activate Bellatrix?
--------------------------
One you have completed your purchase you will receive a number of keys. You need a unique key for each machine where you will use Bellatrix frameworks and tools. Before you can activate the product you need to install or at least download Bellatrix installer from [https://bellatrix.solutions](https://bellatrix.solutions)
If you have installed the product on Windows you can directly access the installer from CMD with the keyword- **bellatrix**. For all other cases you need to first navigate from CMD to the folder of the installer.

```
bellatrix activateLicense --email=bellatrixTest@yahoo.com --licenseKey=2v99d5bb-f0bd-64a3-bg26-1b12517cc05c
```
This is how you activate the product if your OS is Windows 10 and have installed Bellatrix.
```
C:\Users\youUserName\Documents\bellatrix-installer-win-x64\bellatrix activateLicense --email=bellatrixTest@yahoo.com --licenseKey=2v99d5bb-f0bd-64a3-bg26-1b12517cc05c
```
This is the command if Bellatrix is not installed. This is sometimes useful if you want to activate a license on a remote machine.
